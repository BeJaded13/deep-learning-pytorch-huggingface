    "## Getting started with Pytorch 2.0 and Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "On December 2, 2022, the PyTorch Team announced [PyTorch 2.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) at the PyTorch Conference, focused on better performance, being faster, more pythonic, and staying as dynamic as before. \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post explains how to get started with PyTorch 2.0 and Hugging Face Transformers today. It will cover how to fine-tune a BERT model for Text Classification using the newest PyTorch 2.0 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup environment & install Pytorch 2.0 \n",
    "2. Load and prepare the dataset\n",
    "3. Fine-tune & evaluate BERT model with the Hugging Face `Trainer`\n",
    "4. Run Inference & test model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start, make sure you have a¬†**[Hugging Face Account](https://huggingface.co/join)**¬†to save artifacts and experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick intro: Pytorch 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch 2.0 or, better, 1.14 is entirely backward compatible. Pytorch 2.0 will not require any modification to existing PyTorch code but can optimize your code by adding a single line of code¬†with `model = torch.compile(model)`.\n",
    "If you ask yourself, why is there a new major version and no breaking changes? The PyTorch team answered this question in their [FAQ](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/#faqs): *‚ÄúWe were releasing substantial new features that we believe change how you meaningfully use PyTorch, so we are calling it 2.0 instead.‚Äù* \n",
    "\n",
    "Those new features include top-level support for TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, PrimTorch, and TorchInductor. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows PyTorch 2.0 to achieve a 1.3x-2x training time speedups supporting [today's 46 model architectures](https://github.com/pytorch/torchdynamo/issues/681) from¬†[HuggingFace Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about PyTorch 2.0, check out the official [‚ÄúGET STARTED‚Äù](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/). We expect to ship the first stable 2.0 release in early March 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how PyTorch 2.0 works, let's get started. üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This tutorial was created and run on a g5.xlarge AWS EC2 Instance, including an NVIDIA A10G GPU.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup environment & install Pytorch 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to install PyTorch 2.0 and the Hugging Face Libraries, including `transformers` and `datasets`. At the time of writing this, PyTorch 2.0 has no official release, but we can install it from the nightly version. The current expectation is a public release of PyTorch 2.0 in March 2023."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learned how to use PyTorch 2.0 to train a text classification model on the BANKING77 dataset. We saw that PyTorch 2.0 is a powerful tool to speed up your training times. In our example running on a NVIDIA A10G we managed to achieve 14% better performance. The Hugging Face Trainer allows you to easily integrate PyTorch 2.0 into your training pipeline by simply adding the `torch_compile` option to the `TrainingArguments`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I want to mentioned that we reduced the training time by 14%, which could be interpreted in a cost saving of 14% for the training or in 14% faster iterations cycles and time to production. You should be able to see even better improvements by using A100 GPUs or by reducing the \"Trainer\" overhead, e.g. removing evaluation and logging decreases the time down to `364s`. \n",
